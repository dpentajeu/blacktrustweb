	'AboutUs_p1'=>"The events of 2008 in the financial markets caused investors to address concerns within
			their portfolios. Since then, this has challenged traditional thinking about investing and asset
			allocation, diversification, and correlation. For individual investors, risk tolerances have
			been tested, investment assumptions have been overturned, and fundamental truisms have
			been questioned. For this reason wealth advisory company must be prepared to respond to
			a greater need by clients to understand, access, and communicate with advisers regarding
			their current relationship as well as the products and services that may satisfy future needs.
			Moreover, advisors must have sufficient information, from objective sources, regarding all
			products and services owned by their clients to answer enquiries regarding performance and
			degree of risk-at the client, portfolio and individual security levels. This state of affairs poses
			a dilemma for wealth managers, who, for a generation, have adhered to the core principles of
			asset allocation and earned their keep by preaching the mantras of 'buy and hold', 'invest for
			the long term', and when things get tough, 'stay the course'.",
	'AboutUs_p2'=>"Companies have become more concerned with their financial investing because they want
			to ensure their company is producing and investing at its highest potential. The result is the
			trend in hiring investment specialists to do this work specifically. Investment specialists
			assess a company's investment information to provide new and innovative investment advice.
			Specialists collect and analyze financial marketplace information such as economic forecasts,
			trading volumes, financial backgrounds of companies, historical performances and future
			trends of stocks, bonds and other investment instruments to provide financial and investment
			advice for their company or their company's clients. Investment analysts seek out possible
			risks and potential returns from investments, provide guidance and make recommendations
			on these findings. They assess the economic performance of a company based on its current
			investments and seek contemporary methods to invest their money profitably.",
	'AboutUs_p3'=>'We are a multinational investment organisation which consist a group of investment
			specialists who monitor national and international stock and bond markets and the economic
			conditions surrounding all other markets. We also follow major international industries
			such as tourism, oil and gas, forestry, mining, banking and telecommunications, conducting
			detailed studies of different investment opportunities that a company or an individual may be
			interested in investing in. Investment specialists then prepare reports or make presentation to
			managers about the merits of investing in a new company, how the company should invest its
			money and whether they should buy or sell certain investments or securities. Another method
			of analysis is using statistical data to measure the different financial risks associated with a
			particular investment idea.',	
	'AboutUs_p4'=>"We often meet with managers to get better insight into a company and determine the
			managerial effectiveness in relation to the company's investment policies. Usually we
			conduct studies of an entire industry, assessing current market trends, products, and industry
			competition. We keep up-to-date on new regulations or policies that may affect the industry,
			and very importantly, monitor the economy to determine its effect on potential earnings in the
			company's present investments.",
