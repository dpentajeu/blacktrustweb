							“We want to inspire and unite our global community in a common vision of a sustainable,
							just and profitable future”
							<br/><br/>
							Our company social responsibility vision is activated by four strategies:
							<br/><br/>
							Evolve to a global community: Culturally, we are a community – diverse in culture
							and geography, rich in ideas and opportunities – each member choosing where/when to
							participate and yet all connected around a common need to be successful in the global
							meetings industry.
							<br/><br/>
							The alignment of structure and culture makes member collaboration easier and broader,
							and in the process, creates more human connections to knowledge, relationships and rich
							marketplaces, which ultimately unleashes the power of member-generated content to create a
							true, global meeting industry community.
							<br/><br/>
							Re-imagine our business relationship with chapters: The majority of our members connect
							to knowledge, people and marketplaces through our chapters. A successful chapter is a
							critical building block for the evolution to a global community; it determines the richness
							of the human connections for our community and defines the BV experience. A successful
							chapter drives business performance allowing the global community to thrive, and ultimately
							drives success.
							<br/><br/>
							As local communities, BV chapters are places where connections flourish, combining and
							creating new opportunities by and for your peers – the essence of co-creation. It is the chapter
							experience that sets the BV community apart in the meeting and event industry.
							<br/><br/>
							BV will focus on collaborating with chapters to create a relationship that supports the
							richness of experience, as well as delivers business results for both the chapter and the global
							enterprise.
							<br/><br/>
							Elevate the member conversation and experience: As our members and their clients
							become more globally savvy and sophisticated, BV will continue to meet their needs by
							investing in infrastructure and providing higher levels of experience, knowledge and content.
							With the growth of the industry, competition in the marketplace has reached new levels of
							intensity. New destinations, products and services are pushing suppliers to seek higher value
							sales and marketing channels and platforms to drive success. BV will take strong and active
							positions on issues that matter to our community, for example corporate social responsibility
							and student development. As social and environmental responsibility becomes a priority
							for many of our member organizations, BV will be the leader in the meetings and events
							community: It will activate ways to reduce the environmental impact of its own meetings
							and events; and provide the community with inspiration, education and tools on eco-friendly
							processes and procedures.
							<br/><br/>
							Build a great organization: In order to deliver on our vision to be a global meeting
							industry community, it is vital that BV be both internally and externally able to support our
							community in its endeavors to be successful. The result of our great organization will be
							a collaboration of engaged members and passionate BV employees who have one goal –
							success.
							<br/><br/>
							Principles of Professionalism
							BV’s Principles of Professionalism, largely encompassing the UN Global Compact
							Principles, provide guidelines recommended for the business behavior of its members that
							impacts their perceived character and thus the overall image of BV. Commitment to these
							principles is implicit to membership and is essential to instilling public confidence, engaging
							in fair and equitable practices and building professional relationships with meeting industry
							colleagues.
							<br/><br/>
							We are responsible for ensuring that the meeting industry is held in the highest public* regard
							throughout the world. Our conduct directly impacts this result.
							<br/><br/>Maintaining Professional Integrity:
							<li style="font-size:14px">Honestly represent and act within one’s areas of professional competency and authority without exaggeration, misrepresentation or concealment.</li>
							<li style="font-size:14px">Avoid actions which are or could be perceived as a conflict of interest or for individual gain.</li>
							<li style="font-size:14px">Offer or accept only appropriate incentives, goods and services in business transactions.</li>
