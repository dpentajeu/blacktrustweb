			'BinaryOption'=>"Binary Options, also known as Digital Options, all-or-nothing options or Fixed Return Options (FROs) have been available throughout worldwide markets for many years.  In 2008, the United States introduced binary options trading to the traders’ portfolio of financial tools.
						<br/><br/>A Binary Option is in essence nothing more than a prediction of which way the price of a stock, commodity, index or currency will move by a designated expiry time.  With Binary Options, a trader never purchases or owns the asset – he is only predicting the direction that the asset will go.  There are only two possible outcomes, and the price of the asset does not matter.  As far as a trader is concerned, all that matters is if his prediction is correct or incorrect.
						<br/><br/><h3 style='font-size:22px' class='red_title'>Summary</h3><br/>Binary Options are also referred to as all-or-nothing options, since it is a type of option where the payoff is all or nothing. The return is therefore fixed and it comes to no surprise that such options are also known as: FRO's-Fixed Return Options. Digital options is also another commonly used term. More simply a trader just needs to make a decision about the direction of a rate change: whether the underlying asset's price is going up or going down without taking other factors into consideration.
						<br/><br/>Binary Options trading is considered as one of the fastest growing segments of the simplified trading products.
						Binary options are fixed-odds-return investment products that have two possible absolute outcomes with structured reward and risk, hence the word 'binary'.
						<br/><br/>Whether the trader has made a call or put, if at contract expiration the trader has been successful with regards to the anticipated direction of the underling asset price then the contract will expire in the money. On the other hand, if the trader has been unsuccessful in anticipating the direction of the asset, the contract will expire out of the money.
						When the expiry level is equal to the strike price the contract will expire at the money. Normally, there will be a fixed cash settlement to be returned which is often the initial investment, however this depends on what was predetermined and agreed in the contract. A Binary Option reflects specific speculation in financial markets that may happen during a specific time period.
						<br/><br/>For example: Google price is now 430.25$ and you want to speculate on the price movement of the share within a time frame of 1 hour.
						If you think that Google will rise above this price level, than you should buy a binary call option- if the Google price will be above the current price level during expiry than the option will expire in the money, paying you the fixed odds return promised during the trade. If not, the option will expire out of the money.
						If you think that Google will fall below this price level, than you should buy a binary put option- if Google price will be below the current price level during expiry than the option will expire in the money, paying you the fixed odds return promised during the trade. If not, the option will expire out of the money.<br/><br/>",
